# Developer assignment Test - Kevi.io 

### This is a paid test and you will be paid the hourly rate informed by you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a one-page application where you can:
* Insert new people 
* View inserted people on a table 
* Sort people on this table per age and name 
* Delete people A person should contain the following attributes: 
* Name 
* Date of birth 
* City 
* Phone 
* E-mail 

### Technical Requirements: 
* The code (variables, methods, comments, etc) must be in english The backend should be a REST api built on PHP7 with Slim framework 
* The frontend should be separated from the api and built with Vue JS 
* End result UI will be evaluated but isn’t a priority, feel free to use any css framework and preprocessors you like. Prioritize functionality over appearance. 
* Create a README file with instructions on how to build and test the project Process: 
* You have 7 days to finish this assignment after receiving it. 
* You can spend a maximum of 16 hours on this exercise 
* Please send an email when you get to the 8 hours of work mark with a status video informing what you currently have and which will be your next steps, the video can be recorded in portuguese. 
* Once you finish the project or get to the 16 hour mark, shoot a second video with your result, feel free to take this space to justify any technical choice that wasn’t obvious. 
* Send a final e-mail with the video, the code (either a zip or a public git url), the amount of used hours and your bank information so we can pay you for the test. 
* We’ll evaluate every test and return with an answer before the end of May, either to move forward with a video call (in portuguese) or to inform you that we have decided to go on with another candidate.

### Notes: 
* If you think you won’t be able to meet all the requirements, there is no problem, but please make a partial result end to end,for this test, it’s better to have only inserting and viewing but with both front and backend implementation than a full backend with no frontend. 
* If you complete the requirements of the test in less time than you needed, feel free to use the extra time to show-off your skills, work on a beautiful UI, add extra-features, surprise us. Anything related to this test (videos, code, questions, etc) should be sent via e-mail to gabriel@kevi.io with the subject “Developer Assignment”
